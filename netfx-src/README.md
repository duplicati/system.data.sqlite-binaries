# NetFx source

The files in this folder are copied from the [System.Data.SQLite website](https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/downloads.wiki) (public domain license).

This package has the contents from [`sqlite-netFx-source-1.0.118.0.zip`](https://system.data.sqlite.org/downloads/1.0.118.0/sqlite-netFx-source-1.0.118.0.zip).

Only the `SQLite.Interop` contents are retained, as the rest can be used via the [`System.Data.SQLite.Core`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SQLite.Core/1.0.115.5) NuGet Package.

The compile script has been updated slightly to match the folder structure here, and the output folders.
